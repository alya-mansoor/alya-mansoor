### Hi there, I'm Alya! 👋

- 👩‍🎓 I'm currently studying for an Associate of Science in Mathematics and an Associate of Science in Physics at Austin Community College. I aim to transfer for the Fall 2024 semester to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

- 🌱 I’m learning about Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- ⚡ Fun fact - I recently competed in a hackathon, RiverHacks 2024. Check out my team's project on my GitHub profile! My all-female team placed in two categories:
  - Won Best Domain Name from GoDaddy Registry 🎉
  - Won Best Cloud Hack 🎉
